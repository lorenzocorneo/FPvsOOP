# Functional Programming vs. Object Oriented Programming

This research is part of the Research methodologies and Scientific writing's course at KTH.

Aim of the project is to verify whether Functional Programming is more efficient than Object Oriented Programming in terms of productivity and reusability.

Object of the investigation are the lines of code and the code reuse. Line of code are important because the more the developer writes the more time is used. The code reuse allows developers to update in less time newer version of software.
